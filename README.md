# A FPGA on a NuBus card...

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to be able to interface a modern (2021 era) [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) with a [NuBus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuBus) host, specifically Apple's [Macintosh II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_II_family) and [Macintosh Quadra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Quadra).

## Current status

First prototype is working, implements a basic single-resolution, 8-bits only framebuffer over HDMI or VGA.
